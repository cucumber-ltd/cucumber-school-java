@SHOUTY-11
Feature: Shout

  In order to send location-sensitive messages to people nearby
  As a shouter
  I want to broadcast messages to people near me

  Rules:
  - max length of message is 180 characters
  - only shout to people within a certain distance
  - people remember everything they've heard

  Background:
    Given the range is 100
    And the following people:
      | name     | Sean | Lucy | Larry |
      | location | 0    | 100  | 150   |

  @smoke @slow
  Scenario: Listener is within range
    When Sean shouts "Free bagels!"
    Then Lucy hears Sean's message

  @slow
  Scenario: Listener is out of range
    When Sean shouts "Free bagels!"
    Then Larry does not hear Sean's message

  @smoke
  Scenario: Two shouts
    When Sean shouts "Free bagels!"
    And Sean shouts "Free toast!"
    Then Lucy hears the following messages:
      | Free bagels! |
      | Free toast!  |

  Scenario: Message is too long
    When Sean shouts:
      """
      This is a really long message
      so long in fact that I am not going to be allowed
      to send it, at least if I keep typing like this
      until the length is over the limit of 180
      characters.
      """
    Then nobody hears Sean's message
